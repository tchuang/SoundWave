Assignment 5 of HCID 520 User Interface Software &amp; Technology - Interactive Art

* This application utilizes getUserMedia API (to capture voice input from the device's microphone) which currently only works on chrome browser on desktop, laptop, and android device[3].

* Drag interaction only works on desktop or laptop.

* getUserMedia will not work on a local file (file:///), please access the page via a web server. 
  
  If you have installed python, please switch to the project folder in a terminal, then input the following command:
  
  python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
  
  then you can access the project on http://127.0.0.1:8000/ 

I also put a copy on my UW student's website, please access via the following url:
